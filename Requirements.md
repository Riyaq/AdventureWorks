1. The overall total sales of the company should be on display

2. Country-wise internet & reseller sales along with contribution of various categories towards these sales

3. Report should also be able to show sales for the subcategories in the selected category

> A map would locate the countries and their respective sales on a geographical map

> Selecting a bar from the bar chart does not filter data but only highlights the sales contribution of the selected country in all the product categories/subcategories in both the tree maps which can be challenging to interpret. A slicer would help to apply the filter on the entire report
